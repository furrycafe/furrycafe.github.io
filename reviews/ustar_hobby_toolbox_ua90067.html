<h1>UStar Hobby Toolbox UA90067 Review</h1>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XDRwff0.jpg" alt="Hobby Box">
<p>I picked up the UStar Toolbox set from my local hobby store for $29.99AUD as I required a starter tool kit for boat and warhammer modelling. The kit can be purchased from <a href="http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/cXzbc5S">AliExpress here</a>. The  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Nico+Yazawa&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images">Nico Yazawa</a> like character was only part of the reason I chose the kit.

<p>UStar has delivered a well priced starter kit that beats most other options available. While some tools aren't of great quality, the spruce cutters, hobby knife and sanding sticks on their own are good quality and make the kit worth the price.
<br>
I would like to see a slightly larger tool box as the one included doesn't fix common paintbrush sizes, and the files, glue, and parts separator leave much to be desired.
</p>
<p>
<br>
Overall, I would highly reccomend this kit to someone looking to get started in most hobbies.

<h2 id="C1">ToolBox</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6jPo2k8.jpg" alt="Tool Box">
<p>For the price it's nice to see a toolbox included in the kit. The UStar embellishment in the top left is minimal and could easily have a sticker placed over it. The blue sideclips don't feel particularly strong, and the plastic feels as if it will show noticable scratches early in its life.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kvZK8p1.jpg" alt="Only Included Tools">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6up5NDI.jpg" alt="Common Tools">
<p>With just the included tools you're left with adequate room for other common tools. The sanding blocks did fit however they were removed for illustrative purposes.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8okx1qd.jpg" alt="Paint Brushes">
<p>Unfortunately, my Tamiya paintbrushes didn't fit in the box, and by a slim margin too. 8/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C2">Spruce Cutters / Clippers</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/slSCuGY.jpg" alt="Close Up of Blades">
<p>The spruce cutters feel nice too use and are not dripping in lubrication grease as is common with some cheap tools. The grip feels nice and doesn't chafe after cutting 8 small spruces in one session. Slight markings on the anti-rust coating are a slight concern, however this could easily be fixed with anti-corrosion paint. On close inspection slight crevices can bee seen on the right blade. This doesn't affect cutting quality in a significant way (as seen below).
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KECUcM2.jpg" alt="Sample Cut 1">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZHPUvw.jpg" alt="Sample Cut 2">
<p>Spruce cutting was clean and I was able to get in close to the model. 8/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C3">Craft Knife and 15 Blades</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IUI3z3D.jpg" alt="Craft Knife Closeup">
<p>The grip on the craft knife is adequate and the included blades are oiled, so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Unfortunately, the blade holder is a little finicky and I felt as if I was applying too much pressure to secure the blades.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IR4jSjj.jpg" alt="Blade Comparison">
<p>The included blades are not your standard size, and standard sized blades will not fit the knife. The machining of the blades is a bit off but they are still adequately sharp. After only a few spruces they did dull quiet a bit but were still fine for scraping spruces.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hF7niri.jpg" alt="Sample Scraping">
<p>Because of the unique angle of the blades I was able to hold the model and knife in a comfortable position. I actually prefer this cheaper knife to my Friskar's or Excel knifes as it holds more like a pencil as opposed to a potato peeler. 7/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C4">Flat, Half Round, and Triangle Files</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kvslcdi.jpg" alt="Files">
<p>This is where the kit starts to let me down a little. The three files are not consistent, and have left over metal fused to them making sanding with them dangerous to your models. I didn't have any metal models available to test on but rubbing them over my hand, I felt inconsistencies across all three. I would have preffered to see a small cylindrical file instead, but from an advertising perspective more == better. Luckily, you won't be using these files too often. 5/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C5">Coarse, Polishing, and Diamond Sanding Sticks</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ywxtn5n.jpg" alt="Sanding Sticks and Blocks">
<p>I was quiet happy with these sanding sticks. I wouldn't use the coarse one too often, and after cleaning up mould lines with the craft knife the fine diamond polishing stick was my go to for that final touch-up. The soft padding makes working on your models easy. While understandable that a fine file will generally lose efficiency fairly quickly, this one lasted me about 20 minis before I had to start using it at odd angles. They worked alright on my nails as well. 8/10
</p>
<h2 id="C6">Triangle Sanding Block</h2>
<h2 id="C7">Square Sanding Block</h2>
<p>The triangle and square sanding blocks are more intended for model ship building. If you're modelling just warhammer and aren't building any large vehicles or terrain you may put a lower weight on these. Put simply they're about the same quality as the sanding sticks, just on a block. The ones in my kit were not flat in all spots so I am a bit dubious about using those sides. For this reason, I have subtracted a substantial amount of points. If not for this, I'd be inclined to rate them maybe an 8/10 each. 6/10 each
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C8">ABS Glue</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dKHwLsY.jpg" alt="Glue">
<p>If you're just starting out you might be drawn to this kit because it includes everything, even the glue. Note AliExpress will not ship you the glue due to "the mode of transportation". Without the glue I'd say the kit remains just as good. It has a slightly yellow tint to it which I'm not used to with hobby glues. It dries as quickly as Citadel glue but feels a tad weaker. Rather than the typical banana aromatic odour of plastic glues, this one has a more alcoholic odour which indicates to me that is could be diluted strongly with acetone. Some modellers prefer to use superglue on their tabletop minis as it doesn't melt the plastics together, making switch out of weapons easier. As a counterpoint, I'd suggest looking into magnets if that's the road you want to take.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uYh93wz.jpg" alt="Glue Applicator">
<p>Possibly the weakest part of this glue is not it's adhesion factor but rather the applicator. The bristles are splayed so far apart that precision required for warhammer and especially boats is impossible. I'd suggest using a toothpick or cottonbud over the included applicator. As mentioned, it is a shame the glue isn't in a plastic squeeze bottle, they simply make everything a lot easier. 4/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C9">Straight and Curved Tweezers</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kYLnZQR.jpg" alt="Tweezers">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X33HpuP.jpg" alt="Tweezer Heads">
<p>Well they're tweezers and they tweeze well. They have a reasonable amount of bend in the handle which suits my holding style well. Even with a lot of pressure they did not noticably damage any of my models. I would have liked to have seen a softer edge on them, as the potential for scratching your models is there if you're not careful. I wish they had included a spade tweezer instead of the straight tweezer as they have a larger surface area. 8/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C10">Phillips and Flathead Screwdrivers</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zpn8CYO.jpg" alt="Screwdrivers">
<p>Both screwdrivers are a little too large for most modelling kits I've seen. While not indicated anywhere the flathead is a 3.0 and the Phillips head is a 1.0. Both are magnetised. Maybe useful for around the house work, I can't see them being too useful for modelling, although there's probably something I'm overlooking in a hobby I don't partake in.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pSF4C2c.jpg" alt="Screwdriver Heads">
<p>The heads are actually suprisingly good, neither bent when pressure was applied, so they're at least a step above your generic Bunning's screwdriver. Because they're magnetised, they did have metal dust stuck to them, which I can see getting in the way of paint jobs by accident. 6/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C11">Parts Separator</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UzAYdeb.jpg" alt="Part Seperator">
<p>Probably good for laptop repair (maybe that's why the screwdrivers were included), they're not suited for scale hobbying. The plastic damages quickly, making the edge irreparable. As an alternate use, if you don't have a cork or berroca bottle lying around, this makes a decent painting platform. Simply bluetac your model on. 5/10
</p>
<br><br>


<h2 id="C12">Cutting Mat</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SKnRNYr.jpg" alt="Cutting Mat Front">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CA780D9.jpg" alt="Cutting Mat Back">
<p>I didn't know the mat was included so it was a pleasant suprise when I opened the box. The quality is good and it works just as any self healing mat would, albeit small. It's good for scale models; in a sense it forces you to maintain a clean workspace. That said I have ordered an A3 one to replace it. I don't know anyone who actually uses the scales on their mat but they at least make you look more serious. Well suited for sewing miniature clothes too. 8/10
</p>

<h2 id="C13">Conclusion and Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The kit far exceeded my expectations in all honesty. While I know some of the tools will need to be replaced eventually, the price makes it worth it. Again, I would have liked to see a few changes to the some of the tools like the metal files and tweezers, however the tools that matter the most (spruce cutters, sanding sticks and craft knife) deliver where it counts. The included glue shouldn't be used without a different application, and I would highly suggest opting for something like Citadel plastic glue instead. All said however, it's expected that a beginner kit will have a few caveats.
<br>


Overall, I give the kit 70.5 / 100, receiving a "highly reccomended".
